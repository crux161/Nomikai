  # Nomikai ("drinking party") 

  This is a mockup in Vite thatt I worked up in Figma for use with libkyu.
  Hopefully it will implement QQX5's improved streaming compression algorithm.
  This is still highly transitional and just in place to do some testing with the
  front end components while everything is still loosely coupled together :3

  ## Running the code

  Run `npm i` to install the dependencies.

  Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
